# Ride of the Neatos
###### Final project for CompRobo2017
###### By Jeff, Marissa, and Sean

### What is this project?
Ride of the neatos is a project designed to allow a robotic vacume cleaner to follow a sound source. We used "Ride of the Valkyries" for most of our tests.

### How to use:
The code for the neatos is in Paul Ruvolo's [CompRobo](https://github.com/paulruvolo/comprobo17) repository.

This code requires Scipy and Ros. Ros can be installed using the installation instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation). On Ubuntu, Scipy can be installed with ```sudo pip install scipy```.
